# IoT Management Service

The Management service is the end-user web interface to monitor and manage IoT devices.
The service integrates with the [IoT Identity](https://github.com/canonical/iot-identity) and 
[IoT Device Twin](https://github.com/canonical/iot-devicetwin) services to provide device management
for Ubuntu devices.
